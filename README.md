# SM-Synergy
This is a collection of SourceMod addons/plugins/translations for Synergy.
Some of these plugins will also work in other games such as Black Mesa.

If you do not know how to install these plugins, you should probably use the SynDSInstall27015.bat script here:
https://github.com/Balimbanana/SourceScripts/blob/master/Batch/Syndsinstall27015.renametodotbat
There are prompts to fully install/configure the Synergy dedicated server along with SourceMod/MetaMod and a list of plugins that you can choose from to auto-install.
